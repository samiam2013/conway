# Conway

Conway's Game of Life on the terminal in Go (a very basic version)

## Things to improve

- [ ] make the map wrap around left/right and top/bottom (parametric scrolling?)
- [ ] do it with ebiten or another graphics library so they're squares not block chars
- [ ] handle dynamic resize of the window
- [ ] decouple simulation from rendering and allow speed change

 and a bunch more things probably
